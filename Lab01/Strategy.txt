Lab 1 - Classification
Note: Use .py python file (no notebooks)

Tasks

Pre-processing
-Loading data, organizing, pre-processing
-Establish ground truth (labels)
-Reject, ignore "no data = 99"
-Stratified sampling, selecting representative subsamples from multiple images
-Perform training on samples and later try on master data set
-Window size

Training (decide how much data to allocate to training and validation)

Validation (perhaps apply cross-validation)

Testing
-At the end

Hints
-Start simple with stupid baseline reference and keep developing/improving (worst possible classifier)
-Eg. random guess, followed by majority guess, then move on to pixelwise approaches (white = cloud, green = tree, etc)
-Maybe try NDVI with 
-Compare each with the baseline
-Develop a confusion matrix and then derive statistics and metrics
-Examples: accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Libraries and installation
-Conda
-Scikit-learn
-PyTorch
-XGBoost, LightGBM
-Catboost?
