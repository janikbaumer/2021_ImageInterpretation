Oct. 12 Meeting


Potential classifiers (supervised learning on a pixel basis)
-K nearest neighbour with varying k (compare)
-Decision trees
-Random forests
-SVM

Potential metrices
-Accuracy *maybe not so good -> try normalizing, better for classes of the same size
-Precision
-Recall
-F1 score


Libraries
-scikit learn


Input training data
Preprocessing
Learn an algorithm (see above) -> Training
Validation
Testing
Compare different conventional methods (classifiers), produce a confusion matrix for each
